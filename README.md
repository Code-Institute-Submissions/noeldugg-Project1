# DIGITAL AGENCY

When creating this project ,I was conflicted on what I should build my website around.
I started numerous websites and projects but kept discarding them as I coud'nt be definite on
an idea. Until one day my sister asked me could I build her a website for her Digital Marketing 
Agency , as she wasn't happy with the various templates she found online. At first I was unsure 
could I achieve the  website that she wanted ,as I so new to my coding journey but I accpeted her challenge 
and that is where the idea for this website came from.

With DIGITAL AGENCY I Hope to accomplish a sleek website and a amazing user experience so clients
can get in Contact easily and efficiently. The site will hope to attract more clients and users
ranging from all ages as you are never to old or too young too start a business.DIGITAL AGENCY 
will be an easy accesible website for all clients or potential clients as it will aim to be 
an easy user experience.
